**Data Workflow Overview**

Data flows through four general stages in an organization:

1. **Ingestion**: Collecting data from various sources like web traffic, surveys, or media consumption.
2. **Preparation**: Cleaning data (e.g., handling missing or duplicate values), and converting it into a structured format.
3. **Exploration**: Analyzing and visualizing data, creating dashboards, and comparing data sets.
4. **Experimentation**: Running experiments and building predictive models (e.g., forecasting or A/B testing).

**Role of Data Engineers**

* Focus on **ingesting and storing data**.
* Lay the foundation for data analysts, scientists, and ML engineers.
* Ensure data is **organized**, **accessible**, and **usable**.

---

**Responsibilities of a Data Engineer**

* Ingest data from multiple sources.
* Optimize databases for analysis.
* Manage data quality and handle data corruption.
* Design, develop, test, and maintain **data architectures** and **large-scale processing systems**.

---

**Data Engineers and Big Data**

* The demand for data engineers is rising due to the growth of **big data**.
* Big data involves data that is **too large** to be processed using traditional tools.

---
**Growth of Big Data**

* Big data is primarily generated from:

  * Sensors and devices
  * Social media
  * Enterprise systems
  * VoIP communication

 **The Five Vs of Big Data**

1. **Volume** – The massive amount of data.
2. **Variety** – Different types and formats of data (text, image, video, etc.).
3. **Velocity** – The speed at which data is generated and processed.
4. **Veracity** – The trustworthiness and quality of data.
5. **Value** – The usefulness and actionability of the data.
